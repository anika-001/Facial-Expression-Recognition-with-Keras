The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).\n",

The \"pixels\" column contains a string surrounded in quotes for each image. The contents of this string a space-separated pixel values in row major order. test.csv contains only the \"pixels\" column and your task is to predict the emotion column.\n",
